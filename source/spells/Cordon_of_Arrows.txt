Until the spell ends, whenever a creature other than you comes within 30 feet of four pieces of ammunition set on the ground for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, they must succeed on a Dexterity save or take 1d6 piercing damage. One of the ammunition is then destroyed. The spell ends if no ammunition remains.
