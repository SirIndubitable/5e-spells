An elemental disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
The elementals are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them, no action required from you. If you don't issue a commands, they do nothing but defend themselves from hostile creatures.
