Locusts fill a 20-foot-radius sphere. It spreads around corners, remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured and difficult terrain.
When the swarm appears, each creature in its area must make a Constitution save. A creature takes 4d10 piercing damage on a fail, or half on a success. It must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time or ends its turn there.
At Higher Levels: The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above the 5th.
