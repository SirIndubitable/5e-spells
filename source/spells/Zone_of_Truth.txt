Zone of Truth
2nd-level Enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 10 minutes
You create a truth zone in a 15-foot-radius sphere. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma save. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether a creature passes or fails the save.
An affected creature is aware of the spell and can avoid answering questions that it would normally lie in response to. The creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains in the boundaries of truth.
