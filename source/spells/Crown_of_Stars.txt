Seven motes of light orbit your head. You can use a bonus action to throw one of the motes at one creature or object within 120 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 4d12 radiant damage. Whether you hit or miss, the mote is expended.
If you have four or more motes remaining, they shed a bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. If you have one to three motes remaining, they shed a dim light in a 30-foot radius.
