2nd-level Divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: S
Duration: Concentration, Up to 1 hour
Choose one creature you can see. The target must pass a Wisdom save or take 3d8 psychic damage. It takes half as much on a success. On a failed save, you also always know the target's location, but only while the two of you are on the same plane. The target can't become hidden from you, and if it's invisible, it gains no benefits from this condition against you.
At Higher Levels: The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
