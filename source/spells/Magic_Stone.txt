Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute
Make a ranged spell attack with one of up to three pebbles you touch by throwing it or using a sling. If thrown, a pebble has a range of 60 feet. If someone else attacks with the pebble, it uses your spellcasting ability modifier. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + spellcasting ability modifier of bludgeoning damage. Whether the attack hits or not, the spell ends on the pebble.
If you cast this spell again, the spell ends on any pebbles affected by your previous casting.
