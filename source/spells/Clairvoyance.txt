You make an invisible sensor in a location you've visited or seen, or in an obvious location that you haven't. The sensor remains for the duration and canâ€™t be interacted with. 
Choose seeing or hearing. You can see or hear as if you are where the sensor is. As an action, you can switch which sense. 
If something can see it, it sees a luminous, intangible, fist-sized orb.
