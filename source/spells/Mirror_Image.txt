2nd-level Illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute
Three illusions of yourself appear in your space. You can use your action to dismiss the duplicates.
Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell's duration, roll a d20 to see if the attack targets one of the duplicates. If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher for the attack to target a duplicate. With two duplicates, it's an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, it's an 11 or higher.
A duplicate's AC is 10 + your Dexterity modifier. A duplicate is destroyed by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.
A creature is unaffected if it can't see, if it relies on senses other than sight, or if it can see through illusions.
