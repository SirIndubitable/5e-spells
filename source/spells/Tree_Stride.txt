You can enter a tree and teleport to another of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees must be living and at least the same size as you. You use 5 feet of movement to enter a tree, but can leave as part of that. You learn the location of trees of the same kind when you enter.
If you teleport, you appear beside the destination and use another 5 feet of movement. If you have no movement left, you do not teleport and are set beside the tree you entered.
You can use this once per round for the duration. You must end each turn outside a tree.
