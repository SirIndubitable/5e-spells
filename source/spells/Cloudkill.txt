Cloudkill
5th-level Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, Up to 10 minutes
You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point. It spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses it. Its area is heavily obscured.
When a creature enters the fog for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution save. It takes 5d8 poison damage on a fail, or half on a success. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe.
The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the ground. The vapors sink to the lowest level of the land.
At Higher Levels: The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
