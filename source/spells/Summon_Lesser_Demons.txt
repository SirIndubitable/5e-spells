Summon Lesser Demons
3rd-level Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (Vial of blood from humanoid killed in past 24hrs)
Duration: Concentration, Up to 1 hour
You summon demons from the Abyss. Roll to determine what appears.
The DM chooses the demons and you choose where they appear from spaces you can see. A summoned demon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
The demons are hostile to everyone, including you. Roll initiative for the demons as a group. The demons pursue and attack the nearest non-demons.
As part of casting, you can make a circle on the ground with the material blood. The circle encompasses your space. The demons can't cross or harm the circle, or target anyone in it. Using the blood this way consumes it.
At Higher Levels: You summon twice as many demons with a 6th or 7th-level slot. With 8th or 9th level, you summon three times as many.
