Polymorph
4th-level Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (Caterpillar cocoon)
Duration: Concentration, Up to 1 hour
You transform a creature that you can see into another form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom save to avoid it. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.
The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose CR is equal or less than the target's. If it doesn't have a CR, use level. The target's statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.
The target takes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, it gets its original hit points back. If it reverts because it dropped to 0 hit points, excess damage carries over to its normal form. If the excess damage doesn't reduce its normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.
The creature is limited in to the actions of its new form, and it can't take any action that requires hands or speech. Its gear melds into the new form and it can't benefit from any of its equipment.
