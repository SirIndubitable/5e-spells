Heat Metal
2nd-level Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (Piece of iron and fire)
Duration: Concentration, Up to 1 minute
Choose a manufactured metal object that you can see within range. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 fire damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause this damage again.
If a creature is holding the object, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if possible. If it doesn't drop it, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.
At Higher Levels: The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
