Moonbeam
2nd-level Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (Moonseed plant seeds, opalescent feldspar)
Duration: Concentration, Up to 1 minute
A beam of light shines in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.
When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution save. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.Â 
A shapechanger makes its save with disadvantage. If it fails, it instantly reverts to its original form and can't change form until it leaves the spell's light.
On your turn, you can use an action to move the beam up to 60 feet.
At Higher Levels: The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.
