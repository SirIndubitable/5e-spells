Tenser's Floating Disk
1st-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (Drop of mercury)
Duration: 1 hour
This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends and everything falls to the ground.
The disk doesn't move if you're within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away, it follows you so that it remains within 20 feet. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can't cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more.
If you move more than 100 feet from the disk, the spell ends
