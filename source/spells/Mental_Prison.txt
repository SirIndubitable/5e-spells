One creature you can see must make an Intelligence saving throw. The target succeeds automatically if it's immune to being charmed. On a successful save, the target takes 5d10 psychic damage and suffers no additional effect. On a failed save, the target takes 5d10 psychic damage, and you make the area immediately around the target's space appear dangerous. The target can't see or hear anything beyond it and is restrained for the spell's duration. If the target is moved out of the illusion, makes a melee attack through it, or reaches any part of its body through it, the target takes 10d10 psychic damage, and the spell ends.
