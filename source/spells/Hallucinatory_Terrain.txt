Hallucinatory Terrain
4th-level Illusion
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 300 feet
Components: V, S, M (Stone, twig, green plant)
Duration: 24 hours
You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other natural terrain. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed in appearance.
The base terrain is unchanged, so anyone entering the area can see through the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature can attempt an Investigation check. A creature who learns it's an illusion sees it as a vague image over the terrain.
