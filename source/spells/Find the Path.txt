Find the Path
6th-level divination
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a set of divinatory tools—such as bones, ivory sticks, cards, teeth, or carved runes— worth 100 gp and an object from the location you wish to find)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 day
This spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct
physical route to a specific fixed location that you are
familiar with on the same plane of existence. If you
name a destination on another plane of existence, a
destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a
destination that isn’t specific (such as “a green dragon’s
lair”), the spell fails.
For the duration, as long as you are on the same plane
of existence as the destination, you know how far it is
and in what direction it lies. While you are traveling
there, whenever you are presented with a choice of
paths along the way, you automatically determine which
path is the shortest and most direct route (but not
necessarily the safest route) to the destination.
Faerie Fire
1st-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in
blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in
the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if
it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects
and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.
Any attack roll against an affected creature or object
has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected
creature or object can’t benefit from being invisible.
