Plane Shift
7th-level Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (250gp forked metal rod attuned to destination plane)
Duration: Instantaneous
You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane. You can specify a target destination in general or specific terms, and you appear in or near that destination.
Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane, this spell can take you to that circle. If the circle is too small to hold everyone, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces.
You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Make a melee spell attack against a creature in reach. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma save. If the creature fails, it is transported to a random location on the plane you specify. It must find its own way back to your plane.
