Make a melee attack with a weapon. On hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects and if it willingly moves before the end of your next turn, it takes 1d8 thunder damage and the spell ends.
At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 thunder damage, and the moving damage increases to 2d8. Both damages increase by 1d8 at 11th and 17th level.
