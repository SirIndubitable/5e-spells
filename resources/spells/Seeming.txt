Seeming
5th-level Illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 8 hours
You make any amount of creatures you can see look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same limb arrangement. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. If a creature is unwilling, it must pass a Charisma save to be unaffected.
If someone attempts to touch you or any disguised person, they will be able to pass through the illusion. Otherwise, to discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to make an Investigation check against your spell save DC.
