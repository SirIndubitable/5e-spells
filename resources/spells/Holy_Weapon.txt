Holy Weapon
5th-level Evocation
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, Up to 1 hour
Until the spell ends, a weapon you touch emits bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Attacks made with it deal an extra 2d8 radiant damage on a hit. If it isn't already a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration.
As a bonus action, you can dismiss the spell and make the weapon to burst radiance. Creatures you can see and of your choice in 30 feet of the burst[1] must make a Constitution save. On a failure, it takes 4d8 radiant damage and it is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half damage and isn't blinded. At the end of each of its turns, a blinded creature can make a Constitution save, ending the blindness on a success.
