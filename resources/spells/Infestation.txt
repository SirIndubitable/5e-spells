The target must pass a Constitution save or take 1d6 poison damage and move 5 feet in a random direction. Roll a d4 for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if the target can't move or the direction is blocked, it doesn't move.
The damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th, 11th, and 17th level.
