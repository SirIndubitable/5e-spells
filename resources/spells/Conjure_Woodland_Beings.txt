Fey appear in unoccupied spaces you can see. Choose one of the following options for what appears:
A creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them, no action required. If you don't issue any commands, the only action they take is defending themselves from hostile creatures.
At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using higher-level slots, more creatures appear: twice as many with a 6th-level slot and three times as many with an 8th-level slot.
