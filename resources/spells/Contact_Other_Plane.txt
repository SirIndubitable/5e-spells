Contact Other Plane
5th-level Divination
Casting Time: 1 minute (Ritual)
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: 1 minute
When you cast this spell, make a DC15 Intelligence save. On failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can't take actions, can't understand what others say, can't read, and only speak gibberish. A Greater Restoration ends this effect.
On a success, you can ask an entity on another plane up to five questions. You must ask before the spell ends. The DM answers each question with one word. If a one-word answer would be misleading, the DM can offer a short phrase instead.
