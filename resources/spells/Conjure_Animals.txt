Fey appear in occupied spaces in range that you see. Choose one of the following options for what appears:
Each beast is considered fey and beast. It disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
The beasts are friendly to you and your companions. They have their own initiative, but as a group. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them, no action required. If you don't issue any commands to them, they only defend themselves from hostile creatures.
At Higher Levels: Twice as many creatures appear with a 5th-level slot, three times as many with a 7th-level slot, and four times as many with a 9th-level slot.
