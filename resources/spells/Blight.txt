Blight
4th-level Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
A creature you can see must make a Constitution save. It takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
If you target a plant creature or magical plant, it saves with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage. If you target a non-magical plant that isn't a creature, it automatically dies.
At Higher Levels: The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
