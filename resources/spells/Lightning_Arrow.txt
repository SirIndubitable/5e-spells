The next time you make a ranged weapon attack, the weapon (if thrown) or its ammunition transform into a bolt of lightning. Make the attack roll as normal. The target takes 4d8 lightning damage on a hit, or half damage on a miss. This replaces the weapon's normal attack.
Hit or miss, each creature within 10 feet of the target must make a Dexterity save. Each creatures takes 2d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half damage on a success. The weapon or ammunition then returns to its normal form.
At Higher Levels: The damage for both effects of the spell increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
