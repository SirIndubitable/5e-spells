Enervation
5th-level Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, Up to 1 minute
Choose a creature you can see to make a Dexterity save. On a success, it takes 2d8 necrotic damage and the spell ends. On failure, the target takes 4d8 necrotic damage, and you can use your action on your turns to automatically deal 4d8 necrotic damage to it. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else, if the target is outside the spell's range, or if it has total cover from you.
Whenever the spell deals damage, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of the damage taken.
At Higher Levels: The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
