Maximilian's Earthen Grasp
2nd-level Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (Clay miniature)
Duration: Concentration, Up to 1 minute
Choose an unoccupied space on the ground that you can see. A hand rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength save. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained for the spell's duration.
As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, who must make a Strength save. It takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.
To break out, the target can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target is no longer restrained by the hand.
As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.
