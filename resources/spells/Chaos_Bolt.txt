Chaos Bolt
1st-level Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6 damage. After you roll the damage, choose one of the d8s[1]. The number rolled determines damage type.
If you roll the same number on both d8s, the energy leaps to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Make a new attack and damage roll.
A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.
At Higher Levels: Each target takes 1d6 extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.
