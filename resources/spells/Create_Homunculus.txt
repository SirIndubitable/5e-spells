Create Homunculus
6th-level Transmutation
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (Clay, ash, mandrake root; consumed, 1000gp jewel-encrusted dagger)
Duration: Instantaneous
You cut yourself with a jewel-encrusted dagger, taking 2d4 piercing damage that can't be reduced in any way. You then drip your blood on the spell's other components and touch them, transforming them into a special construct called a homunculus.
Whenever you finish a long rest and it is on the same plane of existence as you, you can spend up to half your Hit Dice to temporarily increase the homunculus's hit point maximum and current hit points. When you do so, roll each die and add your Constitution modifier to it. Your hit point maximum is reduced by the total, but it cannot be reduced to lower than 1 hit point. The change to your and the homunculus's hit points ends when you finish your next long rest, and it can't be removed by any means except by the homunculus's death before then. 
You can only have one homunculus at a time. If you cast this spell while your homunculus lives, the spell fails. The homunculus dies if you die.
