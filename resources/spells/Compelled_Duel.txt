Compelled Duel
1st-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom save. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a Wisdom save each time it tries to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you. If it succeeds, the spell doesn't restrict its movement for that turn.
The spell ends if you attack any other creature, if you cast a spell that targets a hostile creature other than the target, if a creature friendly to you damages the target or casts a harmful spell on it, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target
