Choose a point on the ground that you can see. A 20-foot cube centered on that point becomes difficult terrain, and each 5-foot portion requires a minute to clear by hand. Each creature in the cube's area must make a Dexterity save. It takes 3d12 bludgeoning damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.
At Higher Levels: The damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 3rd.
