Each electronic device in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered is subject to random behavior while it's in the area. Unheld devices are automatically affected. If a device is being held by a creature, the creature must succeed a Wisdom save or the device is affected by the spell.
At the start of your turns, roll a d6 for each affected device. The behavior lasts until the start of your next turn unless otherwise stated.
At Higher Levels: The radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.
