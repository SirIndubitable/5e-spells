Wall of Light
5th-level Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (Hand mirror)
Duration: Concentration, Up to 10 minutes
A wall of light appears at a point you choose. It can be in any orientation, and can be free floating or on a surface. It can be up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick. It blocks line of sight, but things can pass through it. It emits 120 feet of bright light and an additional 120 feet dim light.
When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a Constitution save. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't blinded. A blinded creature can repeat the save at the end of its turns.
A creature that ends its turn in the wall's area takes 4d8 radiant damage.
You can use an action to launch a laser from the wall at a creature you can see within 60 feet of it. Make a ranged spell attack. On hit, the target takes 4d8 radiant damage. Hit or miss, the wall's length is reduced by 10 feet. If the wall's length reaches 0 feet, the spell ends.
At Higher Levels: The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
