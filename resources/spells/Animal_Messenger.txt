Choose a Tiny beast you can see with in range. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description. You speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location.
When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn't reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost.
