Wall of Water
3rd-level Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (Drop of water)
Duration: Concentration, Up to 10 minutes
You make a wall of water on the ground at a point you can see. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or make a ring up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall vanishes when the spell ends. The wall's space is difficult terrain. Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall's space has disadvantage, and fire damage is halved. Cold damage causes the area of the wall it passes through to freeze solid. Each 5-foot-square frozen section has an AC of 5 and 15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points destroys it. The wall doesn't replace the hole.
