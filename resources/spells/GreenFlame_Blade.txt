Make a melee attack with a weapon. On hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects and fire leaps to a different creature you can see within 5 feet of the original target. The fire deals damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.
At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target, and the flame increases to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damages increase by 1d8 at 11th and 17th level.
