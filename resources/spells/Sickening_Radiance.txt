Sickening Radiance
4th-level Evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, Up to 10 minutes
Dim light spreads within a 30-foot radius sphere centered on a point. The light spreads around corners and lasts until the spell ends.
When a creature moves into the spell's area for the first time or starts its turn there, it must pass a Constitution save or take 4d10 radiant damage, suffer one level of exhaustion, and emit a dim light in a 5-foot radius that prevents invisibility. The light and exhaustion go away when the spell ends.
