Contagion
5th-level Necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 7 days
Make a melee spell attack. On hit, you afflict the creature with a disease of your choice from any of the ones described below.
At the end of each of the target's turns, it makes a Constitution save. If it fails three times, the disease's effects last for the duration. If it succeeds three times, it recovers from the disease and the spell ends.
Since this spell induces a natural disease, any effect that deals with disease applies to this spell.
