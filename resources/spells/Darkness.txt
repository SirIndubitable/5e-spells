Darkness
2nd-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, M (bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Darkness spreads from a point you choose to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness goes around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.
If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn't being worn or carried, the darkness comes from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object blocks the darkness.
If this spell's area overlaps with light created by a 2nd-level spell or lower, the spell and light is dispelled.
