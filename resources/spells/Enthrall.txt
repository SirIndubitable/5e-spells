You cause creatures you can see that can hear you to make a Wisdom save. Any creature immune to being charmed is unaffected by this spell. If you or your companions are fighting the target, it has advantage.
On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on Perception checks made to perceive any creature other than you until the spell ends or until the target can no longer hear you. The spell ends if you are incapacitated or can no longer speak.
