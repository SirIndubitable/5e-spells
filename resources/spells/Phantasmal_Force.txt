Phantasmal Force
2nd-level Illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (Fleece)
Duration: Concentration, Up to 1 minute
Choose a creature that you can see. It must make an Intelligence save. If it fails, you create a phantasmal phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube. It's only visible to the target. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Investigation check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion and the spell ends.
While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the area of or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of something that could logically deal damage.
