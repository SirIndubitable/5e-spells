The ground in a 20-foot radius becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels. Any creature that can't see the area at the time of casting must make a Perception check against your spell save DC to recognize it as hazardous.
