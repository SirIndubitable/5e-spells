Until the spell ends, a 30-foot radius, 40-foot high cylinder of sunlight shines on a location you choose.
When the cylinder appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution save, taking 4d10 radiant damage on a fail and half on a success. It must also make this save when it ends its turn in the space. 
If you're within 60 feet of the cylinder, you can move it up to 60 feet as a bonus action.
