Dust Devil
2nd-level Conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (Dust)
Duration: Concentration, Up to 1 minute
Choose an unoccupied 5-foot cube of air that you can see. A force that resembles a dust devil appears. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the dust devil must make a Strength saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 10 feet away. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't pushed.
As a bonus action, you can move the dust devil up to 30 feet in any direction. If the dust devil moves over sand, dust, loose dirt, or gravel, it sucks it up and forms a 10-foot-radius cloud of debris that lasts until the start of your next turn. The cloud heavily obscures its area.
At Higher Levels: The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
